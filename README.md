1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

- The end of Q1 through the end of Q2 is a great time to have a kickstarter campaign. The difference between successful and unsuccessful campaigns is higher than the rest of the year. 
- People love things that they can connect with others over. Board Games, multi-episode TV shows, theatre shows, indie bands, podcasts, and documentaries. These are all things that either bring people together, or can start a conversation. 
- Nobody wants to help someone start a restaurant or business. They want a product, but they don't want a business. 

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
- It doesn't include any information about the donors. We don't know where they live, what age range they are in, etc. That could help with marketing future campaigns. 

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- We could include whether or not it was a staff pick to see if that had any potential influence on the success or failure of a campaign. 

BONUS Pt.2

1. Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

- I would say the Mean summarizes the data more meaningfully. It really shows the gap between the average successful campaign and the average failed one. You need a lot of donors in order to have a successful kickstarter campaign. 

2. Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

- There is more variability in successful campaigns. This makes total sense, due to the larger number of backers. When there are more people they are all going to have different budgets and will donate differently.
